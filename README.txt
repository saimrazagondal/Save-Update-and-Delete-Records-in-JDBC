EXPLANATION:
-------------------

Create a database on your computer using xammp or workbench or whatever you see fit. Name the database
as Identity and make 1 table named person. It will contain 4 fields (name, fatherName, organization 
& mobile) respectively. 

The properties.config file contains detaiils of the dtaabase such as username and password. In xammp,
the default username is 'root' and password is blank as shown in the file. Place the file in the
folder as is and load the file into the project so that the properties can be loaded as command
line arguments.

The program should be good to go!
